You can use this GPG public keys to send encrypted emails to me or to verify my identity.

You can also find my GPG public keys on [keys.openpgp.org](https://keys.openpgp.org) for [Felix@jacobi-hamburg.net](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=Felix@jacobi-hamburg.net) (my personal email address) and [felix.jacobi@iserv.eu](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=felix.jacobi@iserv.eu) (email address provided by my employer).

My GPG keys were also uploaded to keys.gnupg.net, anyway I do not recommend fetching it from there as data from keys.gnupg.net is considered to be not trustworthy.
